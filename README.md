# unblockedstuff
Ok so i have made a proxy script for a new site that allows you to get onto all unblocked websites on school chromebooks
ONLY USE IT IN CLASSES WHERE TEACHERS DONT WATCH UR SCREENS!!!
if you are trying to get to a website, TyPE IN LINK DO NOT SEARCH!
link later ;)
so some things dont work on it like online games such as lolbeans.io
unless you can set your region manually, it cannot detect a region since it is proxy based.
